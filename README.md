# Machine translation for everyone

“Machine translation for everyone” is a course developed by the [MultitraiNMT](https://multitrainmt.eu/) Erasmus+ project. It consists of an open innovative syllabus in machine translation, focusing on neural machine translation (NMT) and targeting both language learners and translators. The training materials include an open access coursebook ("Machine translation for everyone: empowering users in the age of artificial intelligence", to be published in 2022) together with more than 220 activities and a pedagogical NMT interface called [MutNMT](https://github.com/Prompsit/mutnmt) that allows users to learn how neural machine translation works.

This repository contains the learning activities and supplementary teaching materials. Activities are implemented with the [H5P web tool](https://h5p.org/) that allows you to download them and embed them into your own teaching materials on Moodle or Wordpress. You can get all the activities by cloning this repository and copying all the files with extension `h5p` in the `activities` folder. You can also browse each chapter's activities and click on the embed button to download specific ones via the [explorer](http://github.io/jaspock/mt4everyone) developed with the [H5p Standalone Player](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone).

The course is organized in 9 units:

1. Multilingualism.
2. Introduction to machine translation.
3. How to choose a suitable MT system. Evaluation of machine translation quality.
4. How to prepare and select texts for machine translation.
5. How to deal with machine translation mistakes. Post-editing and error fixing.
6. Ethical aspects of machine translation.
7. How neural machine translation works.
8. Custom neural machine translation.
9. Machine translation for language learners.

All these materials are outcomes of the EU Erasmus+ project "[MultiTraiNMT](https://multitrainmt.eu/): machine translation training for multilingual citizens" that took place between 2019 and 2022.
