# Machine translation for everyone

[Direct link to the [activity explorer](https://jaspock.github.io/mt4everyone/)]

“Machine translation for everyone” is a course developed by the [MultitraiNMT](https://multitrainmt.eu/) Erasmus+ project. It consists of an open innovative syllabus in machine translation, focusing on neural machine translation (NMT) and targeting both language learners and translators. The training materials include an open access coursebook ("Machine translation for everyone: empowering users in the age of artificial intelligence", to be published in 2022) together with more than 220 activities and a pedagogical NMT interface called [MutNMT](https://github.com/Prompsit/mutnmt) that allows users to learn how neural machine translation works.

This repository contains the learning activities and supplementary teaching materials. Activities are implemented with the [H5P web tool](https://h5p.org/) that allows you to download them and embed them into your own teaching materials on Moodle or Wordpress. You can easily get all the activities by cloning this repository (or downloading a [zipped version](https://github.com/jaspock/mt4everyone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) and copying all the files with extension `h5p` in the different subdirectories in the `activities` folder. 

You can also browse and try each chapter's activities right now via the [explorer](https://jaspock.github.io/mt4everyone/) developed with the [H5P Standalone Player](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone). Click on the `Reuse` option at the bottom to download the current activity. Each activity has additional comments for instructors in the H5P metadata that teachers can read after embedding it into their Moodle or Wordpress sites.

The course is organized in 9 units:

1. Multilingualism.
2. Introduction to machine translation.
3. How to choose a suitable MT system. Evaluation of machine translation quality.
4. How to prepare and select texts for machine translation.
5. How to deal with machine translation mistakes. Post-editing and error fixing.
6. Ethical aspects of machine translation.
7. How neural machine translation works.
8. Custom neural machine translation.
9. Machine translation for language learners.

All these materials are outcomes of the EU Erasmus+ project "[MultiTraiNMT](https://multitrainmt.eu/): machine translation training for multilingual citizens" (2019&ndash;2022).
