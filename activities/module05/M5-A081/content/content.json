Such tools have allowed the integration of *machine translation*, giving the translator an additional resource to work with.\n \nIn recent years, new technologies have led to variations of traditional post-editing. *Adaptive* MT was developed as a feature where edits made by the translator were learned in *real time*, cutting down the number of repetitive edits they had to make in the future. *Interactive* MT works in a similar way, but at *word* level rather than *segment* level. As a translator edits words, the MT system adjusts the output in real time.\n\nOne of the first  CAT tools where Adaptive MT is implemented is *SDL Trados Studio*, while *Lilt* is an interactive and adaptive CAT tool that integrates MT and TM into one interface that *learns* from human translators."}
