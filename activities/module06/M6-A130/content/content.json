Liability refers to taking responsibility for an error introduced by MT. However, liability aside, the decision of using MT for translating safety-critical content leads to a *risk* for the end users, and this represents an *ethical issue*. Confidentiality relates to the risks of *data security*.&nbsp;The *ISO standard for MT post-editing* (ISO 18587) makes no mention of confidentiality, even if the process involves the use of MT, which leads to the risk of *data processing* and *data retention*.<\/p>\n"]}
