Liability refers to taking responsibility for an error introduced by MT. However, liability aside, the decision to use MT to translate safety-critical content leads to *risk* for the end users, and this represents an *ethical issue*. Confidentiality relates to the risk involving *data security*.\u00a0The *ISO standard for MT post-editing* (ISO 18587) makes no mention of confidentiality, even if the process involves the use of MT, which involves *data processing and data retention*."}
