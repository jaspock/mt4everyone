This has changed for two reasons. Research groups were struggling to compete in major European languages and they focused on under-resourced and *minority languages*. Moreover back-translating *monolingual data* allowed for the creation of \u2018synthetic\u2019 data, which led to a *quality improvement* for under-resourced language pairs."}
