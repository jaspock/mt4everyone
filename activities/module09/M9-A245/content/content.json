If, for example, you want to understand the *gist* of a full online article, then *machine translation* might be helpful. If you are writing a short composition in your L2 and want to find out something about *collocation* (for example, what verbs go with &quot;proposal&quot;? Do you &quot;make&quot; a proposal? Or &quot;formulate&quot; a proposal? etc.) then it would be good to use a *concordancer* to find instances of &quot;proposal&quot; in a *corpus*. If you don&#039;t understand a word in a text that you are reading, you could use an electronic *dictionary* to find a *definition* of the word in question.","submitAnswer":"Submit"}
