You may find, however, that the success of the machine translation system might depend on how much training data there is for the language pair in question.

A common observation in contrastive linguistics is that some languages prefer non-finite subordinate clauses, whereas others prefer or even require finite subordinate clauses in similiar contexts. In (1a) below (adapted from Enkin and Mej\u00edas-Bikandi 2016), for example, English uses the non-finite form \"to drive\". (This type of non-finite form is known as \"the infinitive\".)&nbsp;The Spanish equivalent in (1b), however,&nbsp;uses a finite verb form, \"condujera\" (subjunctive, imperfect 1).<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>(1a)&nbsp;We asked the taxi driver to drive as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>(1b)&nbsp;Le pedimos al taxista que condujera lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Think about systematic differences between your L1 and L2.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Create a \"test suite\" of sentences that exemplify these differences and then translate these sentences using at least one free online machine translation (FOMT) system.
