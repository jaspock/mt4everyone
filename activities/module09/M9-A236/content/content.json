This means that all nouns are assigned either feminine or masculine gender, and this often has little or nothing to do with biological sex. The moon ('la lune') is feminine in French, for example, but the sun ('le soleil') is masculine. If we use a pronoun to refer back to the same entity as a noun already used, we have to respect the gender of that noun. So, in the sentence:<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>(1a)&nbsp;<strong>La lune<\/strong> para\u00eet blanche la journ\u00e9e parce qu'<strong>elle<\/strong> est voil\u00e9e par le bleu du ciel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>(1b)&nbsp;<strong>The moon<\/strong> appears white during the day because <strong>it <\/strong>is obscured by the blue of the sky.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>the pronoun 'elle' agrees in gender with 'la lune'.<\/p>\n\n<p>If 'elle' was being used to talk about a person, for example,&nbsp; it would normally be translated as 'she' in English. But in cases where 'elle' is used simply to agree with a preceding feminine noun like 'lune', it is translated using 'it', as in the example above.<\/p>\n\n<p>Do you think the fact that 'elle' is commonly translated as 'she' or as 'it' will cause problems for machine translation? &nbsp;<\/p>\n","placeholderText":"How would a rule-based system handle pronoun translation?
