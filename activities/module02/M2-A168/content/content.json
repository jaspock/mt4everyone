{"media":{"disableImageZooming":false},"solution":{"introduction":"","sample":"<div>1. In the French (fr), Spanish (es) and Italian (it) translations, the speaker simply \"arrives\"&nbsp;in the room or \"enters\"&nbsp;the room. We are not told specifically that they walked into the room. French, Spanish and Italian behave in a way that is typical of Romance languages. In other words, they omit information on manner of motion. German (de) is not a Romance language, but in this example it behaves like the other LOTEs, in that a very general verb \"komme\"&nbsp;that does not necessarily express manner of motion is used (with the preposition \"in\") to translation \"walk into\".&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>2. It doesn't really matter that none of the LOTEs specifically mention walking.&nbsp;The reader will probably assume that the speaker got to the room in question by walking, and anyway, the manner or motion will not be considered terribly relevant by most readers in the LOTEs.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>3. This is a philosophical question the answer to which depends on what you mean by \"meaning\", but if you believe that English has English meanings, French has French meanings, and so on, then it does not seem possible for a sentence in one language to mean the exact same as a sentence in another language. The two sentences might still have meanings that are very compatible with each other, however.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>If you think that sentence \"meaning\" is really about the situation that a sentence somehow describes or represents, then you might think that the LOTEs and the original English sentence all represent the same event, and that's all that matters.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>4. All of the translations in the LOTEs are good equivalents of the English sentence. In other words, they are consistent with the English sentence and function well as sentences in their respective languages. They are a fair exchange for the English sentence.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>5. There is an example of pro-drop in the Spanish sentence. No single word in the Spanish is 'equivalent' to \"he\" in the English sentence. Rather there is a \"gap\", marked by \"[ ]\" in the back translation&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>6. The German sentence refers to the fact that the person in question is sitting. The other LOTEs don't mention this. Nor does the English original.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>7. It is interesting to see the variety of ways in which the \"same\" relatively simple ideas can be expressed in different languages.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n"},"keywords":[{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"}}],"overallFeedback":[{"from":0,"to":100}],"behaviour":{"inputFieldSize":"10","enableRetry":false,"ignoreScoring":true,"pointsHost":1,"minimumLength":10,"maximumLength":500},"checkAnswer":"Check","tryAgain":"Retry","showSolution":"Show Solution","feedbackHeader":"Feedback","solutionTitle":"Sample solution","remainingChars":"Remaining characters: @chars","notEnoughChars":"You must enter at least @chars characters!","messageSave":"saved","ariaYourResult":"You got @score out of @total points","ariaNavigatedToSolution":"Navigated to newly included sample solution after textarea.","taskDescription":"<p>This task requires you to reflect on (1) the way human translators often describe an event in a way that is typical of the target language, even if that differs from the way the source language writer described the same event and (2) whether such different renditions can be considered of equal value to each other.<\/p>\n\n<p>The English sentence below is a real example from the Proceedings of the European Parliament (Europarl7, accessed through Sketch Engine).
