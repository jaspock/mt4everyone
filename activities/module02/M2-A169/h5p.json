When British mathematicians &quot;decoded&quot; secret German military messages during the World War Two, for example, they were basically unscrambling scrambled German (or deciphering encrypted German, to put it more formally). Once the scrambled messages were unscrambled, they still have to be translated (by human translators) from German into English!","defaultLanguage":"en","preloadedDependencies":[{"machineName":"H5P.TrueFalse","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"6"},{"machineName":"FontAwesome","majorVersion":"4","minorVersion":"5"},{"machineName":"H5P.FontIcons","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.JoubelUI","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"Drop","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"Tether","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Transition","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Question","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"4"}]}
