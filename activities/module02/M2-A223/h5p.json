Translation memory tools may be offered as part of a more complex &quot;translation environment&quot; or &quot;translation management system&quot;, in which other tools are also made available to the translator. More advanced translation students should also learn about such environments.","defaultLanguage":"en","preloadedDependencies":[{"machineName":"H5P.Essay","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"2"},{"machineName":"H5P.JoubelUI","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"FontAwesome","majorVersion":"4","minorVersion":"5"},{"machineName":"Drop","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"Tether","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.FontIcons","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Transition","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Question","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"4"},{"machineName":"H5P.TextUtilities","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"}]}
