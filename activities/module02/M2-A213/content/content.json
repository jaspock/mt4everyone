One such metric is called \"bleu\", but there are lots of other metrics (WER, chrF3, and so on) than can be used to show that a machine translation engine is improving. The \"task\" in the case of machine translation is to translate sentences or, preferably, full texts that the engine hasn't already encountered in its experience so far (that is,&nbsp;in training).<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>So, a machine translation program that gets better and better (as measured by a performance metric like bleu or WER)&nbsp;at translating new texts (the task), the more it is exposed to training data (experience), is a great example of machine learning in action.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/div>\n"},"keywords":[{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"},"keyword":"training data"},{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"},"keyword":"translation memory"},{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"},"keyword":"parallel corpus"},{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"},"keyword":"metric*"},{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"},"keyword":"translating"},{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"}}],"overallFeedback":[{"from":0,"to":100}],"behaviour":{"inputFieldSize":"10","enableRetry":true,"ignoreScoring":true,"pointsHost":1},"checkAnswer":"Check","tryAgain":"Retry","showSolution":"Show solution","feedbackHeader":"Feedback","solutionTitle":"Sample solution","remainingChars":"Remaining characters: @chars","notEnoughChars":"You must enter at least @chars characters!","messageSave":"saved","ariaYourResult":"You got @score out of @total points","ariaNavigatedToSolution":"Navigated to newly included sample solution after textarea.","taskDescription":"<p>Tom Mitchell (1997, cited in Goodfellow et al. 2016: 97) provides the following succinct de\ufb01nition of machine learning:<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Can you exaplain how this general machine learning framework, comprising (1) experience, (2) task and (3) performance, can be applied to machine translation?
