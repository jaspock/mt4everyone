When it comes to evaluating performance, bleu is clearly not the only metric developers can use to check whether their machine translation engines are improving with repeated training, but it is still the most commonly used automatic metric in machine translation development. Encourage your students to think of other metrics and their relative strengths.","defaultLanguage":"en","preloadedDependencies":[{"machineName":"H5P.Essay","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"4"},{"machineName":"H5P.JoubelUI","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"FontAwesome","majorVersion":"4","minorVersion":"5"},{"machineName":"Drop","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"Tether","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.FontIcons","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Transition","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.TextUtilities","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"H5P.Question","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"5"}]}
