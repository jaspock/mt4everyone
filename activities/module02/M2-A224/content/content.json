This is the phase in which a system learns a *translation model* from a parallel corpus and a *language model* from a monolingual corpus in the target language.\n\nThe second phase is called *tuning*. It involves finding the optimum weights to assign to the translation model and the language model so that the system outputs the &quot;best&quot; translation.\n\nThe third phase is called *decoding*. This is when a system that has already been *trained* and tuned\u00a0is given a new sentence or text to translate.","submitAnswer":"Submit"},"library":"H5P.DragText 1.8","metadata":{"contentType":"Drag the Words","license":"CC BY","title":"SMT","authors":[{"name":"multitrainmt.eu","role":"Author"}],"licenseVersion":"4.0","authorComments":"* DIFFICULTY: intermediate. * SUPERVISION: self-assessment. * ESTIMATED ANSWERING TIME: 5 minutes. * LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC CONTENT: none. * ADAPTATION TO OTHER LANGUAGES: not necessary. * COMMENTS FOR INSTRUCTORS: none."},"subContentId":"eff7d58b-9ba6-4244-b1f0-e27eb37eb7f1"},"useSeparator":"auto"},{"content":{"params":{"media":{"disableImageZooming":false},"correct":"true","behaviour":{"enableRetry":true,"enableSolutionsButton":true,"enableCheckButton":true,"confirmCheckDialog":false,"confirmRetryDialog":false,"autoCheck":false,"feedbackOnCorrect":"Well done!","feedbackOnWrong":"Try again!"},"l10n":{"trueText":"True","falseText":"False","score":"You got @score of @total points","checkAnswer":"Check","showSolutionButton":"Show solution","tryAgain":"Retry","wrongAnswerMessage":"Wrong answer","correctAnswerMessage":"Correct answer","scoreBarLabel":"You got :num out of :total points","a11yCheck":"Check the answers.
