But, what are parallel corpora after all, where can one find them?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a number of repositories and places where one may find parallel corpora. One starting point is a repository called OPUS. In OPUS one may find generic and domain-specific parallel corpora. Let's take a look.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Go to the OPUS website at <a href=\"https:\/\/opus.nlpl.eu\/\">https:\/\/opus.nlpl.eu\/<\/a> and use the language selector to choose a language combination of your interest. You will get a list of corpora along with some statistics about size and the corpora in different formats. You will also see a column called \u201csample\u201d. Below the table, you have a list with brief explanations of the corpora and links to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Pick 2 of the corpora available for your language combination and explore them by clicking on the \u201csample\u201d column.

To do so, you need to download the chosen corpus in TMX format (you will get a file ending in tmx.gz), uncompress it if your operating system does not do it for you, and upload it to MutNMT data section, filling in all required details (even Domain and that might be different from the one you picked previously in the exercise!) and choosing TMX as the desired format. The corpus will appear in Your Corpora list, where you will be able to share it so that other people can see in it the Public List.
