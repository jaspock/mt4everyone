{"content":[{"content":{"params":{"text":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Translating with an NMT system is not very exciting. After choosing a particular language combination, you usually have a text box in which you can write or paste a few words or sentences or maybe upload a document. After launching the translation, you will see your sentences processed and output by the NMT system. At this point you will just be able to see if the output is up to your expectations or not. Also if the format in your document at least renders well after being processed. Things get more interesting when the system you are translating with is your own system. You know which type of corpora it was trained and optimised with, the scores it produces, the type of text that it will be (and not be) able to cope with. Your expectations will be probably more according to all this work that you previously did. Let\u2019s see if they are actually met and maybe go a bit inside the translation process. And, why not, let\u2019s compare systems. Ready, steady, go!<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will use MutNMT to do this activity.
