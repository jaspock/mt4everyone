Just Say No to Crap<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">To truly go zero, one must commit to refusing to allow crap into your life.&nbsp; Before you buy anything (or accept any freebie) ask: is it designed to be used just once, or for a short time, and then got rid of? &nbsp;Where did it come from and what happens to it when I\u2019ve finished with it? Who produced it and in what conditions? Where do gadgets go when they die? How much do I really need one of these anyway?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">A question I\u2019m often asked is \u2018couldn\u2019t I just use x, then recycle or compost it?\u2019 The answer is yes, it will stop it from going to landfill, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming to do. But consider the resources that went into producing the item before you bought it \u2013 extracting the raw materials, manufacturing it, transporting it\u2026..every time we dispose of something and buy more we repeat this cycle.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Forget about disposability and think instead about value.&nbsp;Why invest your money in something that you expect to use only briefly then get rid of? Disposing of things just means you\u2019ll have to go back to the shops and buy more. Who do you suppose benefits from this?

Take a step back and consider everything you buy that doesn\u2019t last that long, remembering that actual stuff takes more resources to produce than rubbish. Perhaps it\u2019s gadgets that now sit unused in some box, fashion you buy but hardly wear, or leisure equipment that spends most of the time in the loft. All of these come with their own carbon and water footprints, among other environmental impacts too long to list here, and may well have been made using exploitative labour practices. So consider all of these as well as the single-use disposables filling up landfill sacks.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.875em;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If you have a lot of things sitting around going to waste, think about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thezerowaster.com\/getting-rid-of-stuff-waste-free-in-the-uk\/\">passing it on to someone who can use it<\/a><span lang=\"EN-US\">.
