If the connection between neuron A and B is positive and A is excited, it will tend to *excite* B; if A is inhibited, it will tend to *inhibit* B. When the the connection between A and B is negative and A is excited, it will tend to *inhibit* B; if A is inhibited, it will tend to *excite* B. When a neuron receives stimuli from more than one neuron, the activation of each neuron and the *weight* of the corresponding connection are *multiplied together* and then all are *added up*. The activation of the neuron reacting to the stimulus is computed using an *activation function*. This makes it possible to keep the *activation* of the neuron in a defined *range*."}
