{"media":{"disableImageZooming":false},"solution":{"sample":"<div>Sub-word units are needed in order to reduce the vocabulary size and have a manageable amount of embeddings and network weights. By using sub-word units the system is able to translate unknown words, i.e. words not appearing in the corpora used for training, because they can be segmented in smaller units that do appear in the training corpora and the system has learned to translate them. Sub-word units can be learned by using, among others, a method, called byte-pair encoding, that learns how to group the letters that form the words by attending to the frequency of the groupings in running texts.<\/div>\n","introduction":""},"overallFeedback":[{"from":0,"to":100}],"behaviour":{"inputFieldSize":"10","enableRetry":true,"ignoreScoring":false,"pointsHost":1,"minimumLength":150,"maximumLength":400},"checkAnswer":"Check","tryAgain":"Retry","showSolution":"Show solution","feedbackHeader":"Feedback","solutionTitle":"Sample solution","remainingChars":"Remaining characters: @chars","notEnoughChars":"You must enter at least @chars characters!","messageSave":"saved","ariaYourResult":"You got @score out of @total points","ariaNavigatedToSolution":"Navigated to newly included sample solution after textarea.","taskDescription":"<p>Neural machine translation systems usually work by translating <em>sub-word units<\/em> rather than words.
