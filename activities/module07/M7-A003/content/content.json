{"content":[{"content":{"params":{"text":"<p>Consider the encoder of an already trained English-to-Spanish neural machine translation system being fed with the sentence \"Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up\". In a square similar to the one in figure 4 of chapter 7, draw your guess of a possible non-contextual 2-dimensional representation of the words in the sentence; alternatively, you may write down the coordinates for each word. After that, give a possible attention vector that could be used to refine the representation of the word \"waking\" in the first layer of the encoder by combining some of the non-contextual representations. Justify all your decisions. Consider which words should be close without considering a particular context first, and then take into account a different set of proximity rules in the context of this particular sentence.<\/p>\n"},"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"},"subContentId":"11b5d43d-1ca0-4f25-b16b-56b3e558d0af"},"useSeparator":"auto"},{"useSeparator":"auto","content":{"params":{"media":{"disableImageZooming":false},"solution":{"introduction":"","sample":""},"keywords":[{"options":{"points":1,"occurrences":1,"caseSensitive":true,"forgiveMistakes":false,"feedbackIncludedWord":"keyword","feedbackMissedWord":"none"}}],"overallFeedback":[{"from":0,"to":100}],"behaviour":{"inputFieldSize":"10","enableRetry":true,"ignoreScoring":false,"pointsHost":1,"minimumLength":150,"maximumLength":400},"checkAnswer":"Check","tryAgain":"Retry","showSolution":"Show solution","feedbackHeader":"Feedback","solutionTitle":"Sample solution","remainingChars":"Remaining characters: @chars","notEnoughChars":"You must enter at least @chars characters!","messageSave":"saved","ariaYourResult":"You got @score out of @total points","ariaNavigatedToSolution":"Navigated to newly included sample solution after textarea.","taskDescription":"<p>Write your answer in no more than 256 words.<\/p>\n"},"library":"H5P.Essay 1.2","metadata":{"contentType":"Essay","license":"U","title":"Answer"},"subContentId":"752c31c5-fba8-4c36-b2c8-3597982ceb49"}}]}
