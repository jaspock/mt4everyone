The student will draw a square and put related words such as &quot;waking&quot; and &quot;blanket&quot; (or prepositions such as &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;without&quot;) close to each other. There are infinite attention vectors that can be used to produce a contextual embedding for &quot;waking&quot; but the idea is that students justify their decision; a linguistically motivated answer could consider attending &quot;Harry Potter&quot; (subject of the verb), &quot;blankets&quot; (semantically related), &quot;without&quot; (preceding preposition), &quot;up&quot; (the other element in the phrasal verb) and, obviously, &quot;waking&quot;, therefore making up a vector [5%, 10%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 20%, 10%, 30%, 25%].","defaultLanguage":"en","preloadedDependencies":[{"machineName":"H5P.AdvancedText","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"1"},{"machineName":"H5P.Essay","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"2"},{"machineName":"H5P.JoubelUI","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"FontAwesome","majorVersion":"4","minorVersion":"5"},{"machineName":"Drop","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"Tether","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.FontIcons","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Transition","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Question","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"4"},{"machineName":"H5P.TextUtilities","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"H5P.Column","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"13"}]}
