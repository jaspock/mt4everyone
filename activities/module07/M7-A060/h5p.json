The initial vocabulary will be made up of: t, h, e, c, a, i, s, o, n, h. The most frequent group of two symbols is now t+h (tied with h+e and a+t; ties are broken at random), so th is added to the vocabulary, then th+e and then a+t. The resulting vocabulary is: t, h, e, c, a, i, s, o, n, h, th, the, at. The sentence &quot;the cats are meowing&quot; will be splitted as: the c at s a r\/unknown e m\/unknown e o w\/unknown i n g\/unknown.","defaultLanguage":"en","preloadedDependencies":[{"machineName":"H5P.Essay","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"4"},{"machineName":"H5P.JoubelUI","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"FontAwesome","majorVersion":"4","minorVersion":"5"},{"machineName":"Drop","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"Tether","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.FontIcons","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.Transition","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"0"},{"machineName":"H5P.TextUtilities","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"3"},{"machineName":"H5P.Question","majorVersion":"1","minorVersion":"5"}]}
