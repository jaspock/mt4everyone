These units are then incrementally extended by performing a number of merge steps as specified by an integer that represents the number of merge operations. A merge step implies choosing the most frequent pair (ties broken randomly) of sub-word units in a corpus and joining them in a new sub-word unit. What will be the vocabulary of sub-word units resulting from applying the BPE algorithm to the sentence \"the cat is on the chat\" with 3 merge operations? By using the resulting vocabulary, how will the sentence \"the cats are meowing\" be divided into sub-words?&nbsp;Justify your answer.<\/p>\n"}
